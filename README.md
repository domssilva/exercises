## 0 - Introduction to Computer Science
[CS50 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0WoVEr0-44&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmGw5fN5BQlwuug-8bDmabi)

### Section Objectives
Get to know the basic terminology, what is computer science, what is programming, how computers understand programming languages, how the internet works etc...

### Section Projects
* [x] Watch the cs50 playlist
* [x] Understand how the web works
* [x] Understand the HTTP protocol
* [x] Understand the Client/Server model

## 1 - HTML and CSS
* [MDN: Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)

### Section Objectives
The goal for this section is to getting comfortable structuring websites.
First you must know all the HTML and CSS Basics.
After that you must get comfortable creating micro-components. Think of webpages like lego pieces together; You won't start by building everything at once, first you will learn how to build the tiny pieces.

Practice:
  1. go to your favorite websites
  2. curate all the micro-components that you like from these sites (navar, sidebar, form, footer, etc...)
  3. start building
  4. repeat

### Section Projects
* [x] Read the MDN web development guide
* [x] Get the freecodecamp responsive web design certification (300H)
  * [x] ![webdesign certification](public/FCC__webdesign.png)
* [x] Learn the CSS layout techniques: positioning, flexbox, grid system, box model, media queries
* [x] Build at least 12 responsive micro-components (navbar, header, footer, form, hero)
  * [x] [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/Dqpemp)
* [x] Build 5 single-page websites
  * [x] 1 [dev.to replica](https://devto-replica.netlify.app/)
  * [x] 2 [youtube replica](https://youtube-replica0.netlify.app)
  * [x] 3 [1stwebdesigner replica](https://1stwebdesigner-replica.netlify.app)

  * [x] 5 [terraplanter replica](https://terraplanter-replica.netlify.app)

## 2 - Javascript
### Section Objectives
Conquer javascript. Know it well enough to be dangerous. Strive for in depth knowledge instead of trying to learn many programming languages.
In this section I want to focus on how to build components using vanilla javascript. The section projects consists of building micro components with the best of my capabilities.
In this section I will be also focusing on learning about the most common used design patterns to solve those problems.

## 3 - React
### Section Objectives
Build javascript applications faster. More scalable and maintainable. Just because you can do everything with pure javascript it doesn't mean you should all the time.
The main goal of this section is to understand WHY a library/framework helps so much and also how to learn it by just using its documentation.

### Section Projects
* [x] Read the React documentation
* [x] Go through the official React guide
* [x] Understand the State and UI
* [x] Get the free code camp front end libraries certification
  * [x] ![frontend certification](public/FCC_frontend_libraries.png)
* [ ] Learn Redux

## 4 - Job hunt projects to have:
Don't use toy projects in your portfolio. Show that you can build professional looking websites/apps

* [x] Portfolio
* [ ] Restaurant website
* [ ] Digital Agency website
* [ ] Real estate web app
* [ ] E-commerce web app

## 5 - NodeJS/express, MySQL
### Section Objectives
Understanding the basics of server-side programming will enrich your knowledge about dynamic applciations and data processing. By learning nodeJS and it's ecosystem you'll get a powerfull toolbox letting you use javascript in both frontend and backend.

### Section Projects
* [x] Learn node.js
* [ ] Learn how to build APIs  
* [ ] Build anything that takes data in and stores it into the db

## Never stop Learning
Technology changes really fast, keep learning new things, solidify what you already know. Always refer to the official documentation and keep reading, exploring and coding.
